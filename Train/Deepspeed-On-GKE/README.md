# LLM traing on GKE User Guide
In this repo, we will guide you to run LLM training on GKE.

We provided quick start for few LLM models, like [bert](./Bert-Deepspeed), [T5](./T5-DeepSpeed) by using deepspeed, [Llama2-Deepspeed](./Llama2-Deepspeed), [Llama2-Torchrun](./Llama2-Torchrun) by using both deepspeed and torchrun to run training on GKE.
